# ConfigFileParser
==================================
Using Flex &amp; Bison to Parse Config Files 

> Format of the config file is similar to JSON, which is composed of pairs of key-values. The config file is also composed of some tuples, which contain some pairs of key-values. e.g.

```
section {
 key1 = "string";
 key2 = 12.34;
}
```
